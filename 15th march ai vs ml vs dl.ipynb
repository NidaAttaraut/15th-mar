    "Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. It encompasses a wide range of technologies and techniques aimed at enabling machines to perform tasks that traditionally require human intelligence. For example, AI can be used in chatbots to provide automated customer service, in self-driving cars to navigate and make decisions on the road, or in recommendation systems to personalize content for users.\n",

    "Machine learning is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that allow computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data without being explicitly programmed. For instance, machine learning algorithms can analyze customer data to predict their preferences and suggest personalized product recommendations.\n",

    "Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain's neural networks. It involves training artificial neural networks with multiple layers of interconnected nodes, allowing them to learn hierarchical representations of data. An example of deep learning is image recognition, where a deep neural network can be trained to identify and classify objects in images with high accuracy.\n",

The test set helps assess the model's generalization and performance on unseen data.\n",

    "Unsupervised learning can be used in anomaly detection by leveraging its ability to learn patterns and structures within data. The algorithm is trained on a large dataset containing normal, non-anomalous data. It learns the inherent patterns and structures in the data, creating a model of normal behavior. When presented with new, unseen data, the algorithm can compare the observed data against the learned model of normality. If the observed data deviates significantly from the learned patterns, it is flagged as an anomaly. Unsupervised learning algorithms such as clustering or autoencoders can be applied for anomaly detection tasks."
